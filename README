BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system using the g++ compiler.  To build the program, type 'make' 
   to create the executable called 'prog4'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog4' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program will read ints from the keyboard for amount of horsepower and call on different methods.
The program uses a conversion factor of 1 hp = 745.7 W as specified by a student in the #claiming channel to create a unit class.
PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes from the keyboard.  Input of amount is asked at the start.

PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to the screen for unit conversion.

PROGRAM DESIGN
      The general algorithm
      read the input from user
      call on different methods to return a value
      Use overload operators to perform comparisons
